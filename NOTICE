Requirements:

As recently VID and PID used by lthor downloaders has been
black listed in CDC ACM kernel driver, lthor since version 2.0
uses libusb for communication.

<OS X>

(Requirements: OS X 10.7, 10.8)

To use lthor >= v2.0 it is required to unbind CDC ACM
driver from the device. This can be done using this:

$ kextstat | grep AppleUSBCDC | awk '{print $6}' | xargs -L1 -I{} sudo
kextunload -b {}

WARNING:
This command unbinds CDC driver from all devices in system.

This can be also achieved by writing codeless kext for device with
suitable VID and PID.
